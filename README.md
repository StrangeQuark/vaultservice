# Vaultservice
**Vaultservice** is a secure microservice for storing and retrieving environment variables and secrets.<br><br>
It uses AES encryption to protect variables at rest, and supports a hierarchical structure of services->environments->variables.
<br><br><br>

## Features
- AES-256 encryption for all variables
- Upload and retrieve variables in a secure environment
- Organize variables by services and environments
- Supports uploading and fetching `.env` files
- Optional JWT-based user authentication via external Authservice
- Ready-to-run Docker environment
- Postman collection for testing and exploration
  <br><br><br>

## Technology Stack
- Java 17+
- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL
- Docker & Docker Compose
- JPA (Hibernate)
- JUnit 5
  <br><br><br>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Java 17+ (for development or test execution outside Docker)
  <br><br>

### Running the Application
Clone the repository and start the service using Docker Compose:

```
git clone https://github.com/StrangeQuark/vaultservice.git
cd vaultservice
docker-compose up --build
```
<br>

### Environment Variables
The `.env` file is required to provide necessary configuration such as encryption secrets and database credentials.
Default values are provided in `.env` file so the application can run out-of-the-box for testing.

⚠️ **Warning**: Do not deploy this application to production without properly changing your environment variables.
The provided `.env` is not safe to use past local deployments!
<br><br>

## API Documentation
A Postman collection is included in the root of the project:

- `VaultService.postman_collection.json`

This collection provides examples for:
- Creating, fetching, and deleting services, environments, and variables
- Uploading and downloading `.env` files
- Authenticating requests and adding/deleting users from services (if using Authservice)
  <br><br>

## Testing
Unit tests are provided for all repository and service-layer logic.
<br><br>

## Deployment
This project includes a `Jenkinsfile` for use in CI/CD pipelines. Jenkins must be configured with:

- Docker support
- Secrets or environment variables for configuration
- Access to any relevant private repositories, if needed
  <br><br>

## Optional: Authservice Integration
Vaultservice can integrate with a separate Authservice microservice to support JWT-based authentication and per-user service access control.

To enable this:
- Forward the `Authorization` header to Vaultservice (usually handled by an API gateway).
- Use valid JWT tokens generated by Authservice.
